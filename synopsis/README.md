# Comparative edition of notated chants from old Bohemian manuscripts

## Edition principles

### General

* **digitized first:** start by a survey of manuscripts available online to prepare tools and an initial dataset before going to museums and archives to consult the "parchment-only" sources
* **take everything:** all relevant sources, regardless of their age (early/late) and provenance (cathedral/monastery/parish; Catholic/Utraquist), should eventually be included
* **Prague rite:** primary field of interest of this edition are pieces that at some point of time were part of formularies of saints proper to the Prague province.

### Dealing with musical information

* only notated pieces included (full texts of the liturgical formularies will be provided in a separate edition)
* merely orthographical differences are ignored
* internal structuring of neumes is ignored altogether, only "absolute melodies" are being compared
* differences consisting only of a presence or absence of *strophicus* (notation element with very high variability in the sources) are ignored

## Structure and building

Each feast has it's own directory.
It contains a main document, named like the directory with `.ly`
extension added, containing all pieces and their variants.
Each piece is described in it's own file, which can be compiled
both included in the main file and standalone.
