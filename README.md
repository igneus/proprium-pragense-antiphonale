# Officia propria ecclesiasticae provinciae pragensis cum cantu

Project combining edition of Divine Office chants from Bohemian
medieval manuscripts and composition of tunes for recently introduced
Latin liturgical texts in order to allow fully chanted Divine Office
on feasts proper to the Czech and Moravian dioeceses.

Apart of a post-Vatican II proper common to the whole Czech Republic
a pre-Vatican II proper of the Prague province (alone) is being
prepared, as they share a lot of textual material.

A comparative edition of notated chants for the feasts in question
from Bohemian medieval manuscripts as well as edition of liturgical
texts of the feasts, documenting their development,
is being prepared as a resource
necessary for creation of the abovementioned practical editions.

## Methodology

* **pieces present in the 20th century chant editions:** take the version from the edition of that period (Vatican edition for the pre-Vatican II proper, most recent Solesmes edition for the post-Vatican II one)
* **pieces present in medieval Bohemian manuscripts:** take a restored version based on a comparison of known sources
* **texts missing a musical setting:**
  * as a replacement (cf. GILH 274) offer a piece from ancient formularies of the same feast (if available)
  * also provide a setting of the official text

## Project Structure

* `breviarium_romanum` - Bohemian "antiphonale supplement" for the pre-Vatican II Divine Office
* `liturgia_horarum` - Bohemian+Moravian "antiphonale supplement" for the post-Vatican II Divine Office
* `texts` - edition of the liturgical texts
* `synopsis` - edition of ancient tunes
* `neo` - working directory where neo-gregorian chants are being created
